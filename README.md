Revox Project is a shop written by our team with **PHP**, **SQLSRV**, **MySQL** Also we used free bootstrap templates from google.

The shop come with Admin Portal (you can delete it) also it work from inside the game only , You need to install **MySQL** server (I will not go into details)
also you need to install **PHP** with **SQLSRV Drivers**.

## Intallation
First you need to excute this SQL Query in your **SQLServer** to make the shop smp
[shop_login.sql](https://github.com/ham999dy/Revox-Project/blob/master/shop_login.sql)

After setting the **MySQL** server you need to open the SQL folder that included with the Shop archive and excute the sql files inside the MySQL server using `phpMyAdmin` (you can download it [from here](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/downloads/)), 

Then You need to edit the Config.php and the Admin/Config.php, Put all your correct **MySQL** & **SQLserver** connection information.

- When you add a new item the item goes to the **MySQL** database.
- When the player buy a new item the item will go to the BILLING database. in **SQLserver**
- The point table is inside the Auth database in **SQLserver**.
